            <td>Explanation 1: There is a lack of data of other immigrant populations because most of the information that is available now is mainly focused on hispanic students. This lack of data prevents a performance comparison between undocumented students.</td>
            <td>Explanation 1: Undocumented students face more issues than students with legal status because they believe college is expensive and they are putting themselves at risk by simply attending a college. Because of this and many other personal things, they decide to join the workforce because they believe that is the only way to survive.</td>

          <td>Evidence #2:<u>“This is the year when most students find out that they don't qualify for FAFSA and the majority of scholarships. First because they don't have a social security number and second because they are not "legal" permanent residents or citizens of the United States. Many students by this point are discouraged and don't believe that going to college is a possibility.”

      <tr>
        <td>Explanation #2: There is not a specific number of undocumented students attending college because there is no Survey that asks for their legal status, but because of this, it makes it harder for researchers to compare the numbers of undocumented students and students with legal status. This lack of information also makes it hard to analyze the experiences of undocumented students in college.</td>
        <td>Explanation #2: High Schools fail to provide information regarding student aid, especially for undocumented students, which consequently leads to students being discouraged and not even applying to colleges. </td>

          There is a lack of information over all, students do not receive the help they need, there is no information on other undocumented students besides Latinos, and students are not encouraged to apply to college. Also, it is hard to know how to help students because you there is no way to know who is undocumented and who is not, which consequently makes it difficult to find a solution to the problem.

          <h2><b>Root Cuase #1</b></h2>
          <p style = "padding-left: 10px;">There is a data limitation that prevents researchers from understanding the sources of educational equality for undocumented students because they are so hyper-selected that it limits the comparison of documented and undocumented performances. Also, most of the existing research is focused on the experiences of Latino youth, but almost nothing of other undocumented populations.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="column">
          <h2><b>Root Cause #2</b></h2>
          <p style = "padding-left: 10px;">There is a misunderstanding when it comes to financial aid for undocumented students. Once students reach their senior year, they realize they are not eligible for FSA which discourages a student from applying because they believe that dream is not possible. Although it is harder for students to get financial aid, it is still possible as there are different scholarships, and the CADAA is like the FSA but for undocumented students.</p>
