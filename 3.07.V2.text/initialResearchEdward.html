        <h1><u>What Is Happening?</u></h1>
        <p>According to an article written by <i>The Nation</i> more than 427,000 undocumented students are enrolled in postsecondary education, which represents 2% of all college students but many still don’t apply. In addition to that, there are approximately 338,000 students who are first generation students according to the <i>Higher ED Immigration Portal</i>, but due to the term “first-gen” having different meanings among colleges many students miss out on the potential resources that are given to first generation students. For undocumented students, the college application process is complicated due to legal, financial, and social obstacles, and many do not get enough help or get encouraged, but it is possible to help them. When it comes to first generation students, the requirements of a “first-gen” vary and that makes it hard for them to know if they are eligible or not, as some colleges may define a first gen as “someone whose parents never went to college” OR “someone whose parents went to college but DID NOT receive a Bachelor’s degree”. </p><br>
        <h1><u>Why is this important?</u></h1>
        <p>First generation and undocumented students get affected by the lack of information, help, encouragement, and the overall misunderstanding of college. Some students believe they can’t afford college, others believe they can’t go because they aren’t legal, and others don’t even know how to start or where to start applying to college. This problem goes beyond “schools not teaching it” as some students get affected by their parents and some aren’t even given the freedom to explore themselves and know what they want to do with their lives. I believe students need a resource that provides clear instructions as to what to do when applying to College based on their own personal needs/problems, as some may need help with discussing career plans with parents, others may need help finding financial aid, and others may just need encouragement and someone who checks up on them.</p><br>
