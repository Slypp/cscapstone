            <td><u><b>Explanation:</b></u><br>An app allows for fast and easy access to any information that you need and want and the information is free to use by anyone. The efficiency is also helped by the fact that the interface is easy to use and understand, which helps parents and teachers understand what type of information is being given to them.

I believe that creating a broad and reliable source of information will help students during the application season.</td>
          <td><u><b>Explanation:</b></u>By creating a data source for students, it will make it easier for them to complete applications. They will be able to look up whatever information they need; scholarships, colleges, requirements, deadlines, etc. Facilitating the application process, will also help students with stress and will allow them to enjoy their last fall in high school, their last winter in high school, and their spring in high school</u></td>
